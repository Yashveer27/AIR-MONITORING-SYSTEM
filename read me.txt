HARDWARE PART-
here we have air monitoring system HARDWARE
which include mq 135 which is a air quality sensor which is very sensittive to smoke and harmful gases like NO DERIVATIVES,SO2 ETC
NOW COMING ON CONNECTIONS
this a0 pin  is for analog output which is going to connect in ANY  analog pin of arduino i am connecting in a0.
and vcc and gnd of mq 135 is connectedto vcc and gnd of arduino respectively.


now we are going to place bluetooth sensor HC 05 ON BREAD BOARD THIS IS HC 05  we are going to use only 4 pin of bt sensor.vcc,gnd,rx(receiver),tx (transmitter). vcc 
and gnd connection are same  as explained earlier .but rx and tx is connected on tx and rx of arduino .

THEN WE ARE GOING TO UPLOAD ARDUINO  CODE ON THE BOARD

 Then after uploading code run proceesing code and side by side run phython mail sending.
then automatically when file.txt become 1 email is send .
